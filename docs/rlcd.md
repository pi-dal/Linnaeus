# RLCD implementation

The Linnaeus training recipe keeps the Qwen3.5-0.8B vision encoder frozen and trains language LoRA adapters
(rank 8, alpha 16) plus a shared candidate scorer.
The pinned base is `Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B` revision
`2fc06364715b967f1860aea9cf38778875588b17`.

The numerical reference is [Laya Vision `vlm_loss`](https://github.com/r33drichards/laya-vision/blob/86ccec115ef3d72d1851168fc9b7194e8dbed35a/laya/vlm_train.py)
and [Laya's typed-decisions training notebook](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/blob/d113dca2512fb3eaca313534bc54c7162d87c1d4/notebooks/laya_finetune_typed_decisions_2xT4_kaggle.ipynb).

Shared prefixes and parallel question suffixes produce candidate logits without
autoregressive generation. Draw four
Gaussian perturbations with sigma 0.3, center each over valid candidates, and
score their softmax distributions. The reward adds log score (floor −9.21) and
0.75 times spherical score; ordinal questions also subtract RPS divided by K−1.
Subtract the group mean reward for each question, then divide all advantages by
one sample standard deviation across groups and questions, plus 1e−6. Both the
sampled logits and rewards are detached in the policy-gradient calculation.

The training loss is this policy-gradient loss plus soft cross-entropy with
weight 1. This is one joint training path, following Laya; there is no separate
SFT warm-up, reward model, critic, or autoregressive rollout. Policy loss can be
negative and noisy, so cross-entropy, reward, and held-out accuracy are logged
separately. Clipping and this gradient estimator do not prove calibration.

Candidate-selection (`choice`) candidates are shuffled during training with their targets. Binary
false/true order and ordinal level order stay fixed. Soft labels are normalized
within tolerance; VQAv2 yes/no votes and typed-decisions distributions retain
uncertainty rather than being converted to hard labels.

The training recipe is defined in `src/linnaeus/recipe.py`: equal probability per
source/language/task group, deterministic sampling with replacement, at most
6,000 eligible source rows in each group's training pool, batch 8 with four
accumulation steps, a default budget of 3,600 updates, LoRA LR 1e−4 and head LR 5e−4,
72 warm-up updates, cosine decay to 10% through update 2,400, then a fixed
10% floor through update 3,600; weight decay 0.01 and gradient clip 1.
The default run processes 115,200 sampled examples. Each run freezes the eligible
IDs and source hashes; sampling with replacement can revisit an example.

Every 400 updates, evaluate the same deterministic development subset of up to
256 examples per group. Select by unweighted group macro top-1 accuracy; test
labels never select a checkpoint. Save trainable parameters, optimizer, step,
RNG state, recipe, and selected score. Sampling depends on seed and absolute
microbatch index, so restarting does not restart the data stream.
Extending the total budget retains the original decay horizon and uses its final
learning-rate floor for the additional updates; optimizer moments are preserved.

Merge LoRA, then fit three temperatures, one per decision type, on the independent calibration
partition using LBFGS (100 iterations, LR 0.1, temperature range 0.1–10). Final
reports retain both raw and calibrated metrics. Raw predictions include IDs,
target distributions and logits so plots and metrics can be regenerated.

Only `sigma` and `ce_weight` configure RLCD; `--steps` controls the training budget.
The default values above match
the pinned upstream objective; the remaining estimator and reward settings are fixed.
